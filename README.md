## Long Term improvements

--- Specific improvements to make on holistic projects:

1111. SITE OPTIMIZATION SUPER REQUIRED ESPECIALLY PROJECTS PART

1. In config.js, change all data formating functions into promises so that they dont freeze the screen on initial load of the webpage. (1 month duration)
1. Enable lazy loading of some parts of some components.
1. Reduce refreshing of webpage, look into features of react and next.
1. webpage optimizations
1. improve searching, select correct data structures, algorithms. Use structures correctly and select best search algorithms instead of generically choosing own; structure code efficiently; use object scope efficiently.

1. In config.js, improve scope use in formating of the data object, where to put returns and array growth. (1 month)
1. Use full stack framework (e.g next), to implement entire project, be as well versed in Next as in jquery. (3 months), eternal work item as should be done as newer frameworks are released. Atleast once every 3 years, forever.
1. change all police station data manipulation from files to cloud database and then into an API. No hurry 6 months, then make money off of it, attach to company, advertise, sell.
1. change police station project component into API in its entirety, look for more statistics. 6 months
1. change site management project component into API/stand alone project on its own 6 months.
1. Deploy projects to cloud infrastructure, enable monitoring and management, in cloud model. 3 months

1. Change project to typescript and get as versed in it as in vanilla javascript => 6 months
1. Insert animation gameplay on site selection, project selection, activity based on the statistics of the site. => 6 months

--- Total: 36 months of work on this project alone => 3 years => starting 2025: 37 years,,, ending 2028: 40 years

## Funky interests

1. Perusing package entails on github
2. Still love fiction, has something with keeping my interests while opening my creativity, the same reason i love the book of Revelation in the Bible(i dont really care about the meanings behind, we'll all find out when we get there, in due time)

## Observation Improvements

1. The config file is getting too big, different parts need to go where they are supposed to i.e . API, database etc
2. All the information that should be secret in the config file need to be placed where accordingly, they should not be part of what i upload to Github where anyone get abuse and get me arrested.
3. Get nice icon for the police stations, eventually in 4 colors, red, orange, yellow,green for the ratings.
4. The about me panel, should show a short line of who i am, when clicked it should show the full description.
5. The passions panel, host all the projects live and have the hyperlink take you to them.
6. Look into security here, some of the information here should be private unless password provided.
