As an accomplished Telecoms and ICT Engineer my focus encompassed three key ambitions: first, to drive ongoing innovation within the telecommunications and ICT environment, second to ensure smooth transition, operation and integration when legacy technologies and cutting edge solutions collide as very few projects have been "green fields", there has always been a legacy or previous generation technology eco-system that must be respected where most times a technology overhaul is not financially or otherwise viable, and third to train young engineers and technicians; transfer skills, experience and sometimes passion while helping others with career registrations (ECSA) and further education (BTech and diplomas).
With a solid foundation on organisational and technical principles, that fed into exemplary skills in technology strategy, buisness case formulation, maintenance and training documenation and technical specification development. All this enabled me to lead and participate in technology strategy revision activities, tender advertisement and response events, steering commitees at different levels, community unions engagements when deploying projects, research, operational health and risk identification events, programme leadership sessions and budgeting amongst other things. I aspire to ensure the cooperation of legacy and new technologies without degrading service, ensuring maintenance is defined in a way that ensures lifespan of technology, ensuring scalability, adaptability and resilience in todays dynamic technology environment. Amongst people i aim to remain a bridge
between different levels of understanding (Engineers, technicians and managers) while facilitating a free flow of allowed information to inspire growth, introducing one to the opeational environment of the other and its practices. I am seeking an employment opportunity that encourages professional growth, development and leadership within a multi-dimensional and
performance-orientated organization. In the past 3 years, from my professional experience of struggling with monitoring platforms in the operational environment, specifically for legacy communication technologies as they are usually not supported by current platforms, i have been learning and polishing skills in front-end technologies (React, Bootstrap, Nextjs, Bulma, jQuery, Webpack, Babel, leaflet) along with mastering the actual language (Javascript), markup (HTML5) and styling(CSS). I further contributed to one development community namely "Overmind-xyz" probably a scam, but the exercise was good, it exposed me to different aspects of code structure of things and an "add on" language in practice by way of typescript. For personal creativity and development, i re-started a family buisness and worked on my people and environmental awareness (social aspects of operational environment, leadership etc.); in addition to this i fell inlove with my reading again and did a couple of re-reads on my favourite titles.
